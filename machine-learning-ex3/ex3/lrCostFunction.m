%LRCOSTFUNCTION Compute cost and gradient for logistic regression with

%   J = LRCOSTFUNCTION(theta, X, y, lambda) computes the cost of using
%   theta as the parameter for regularized logistic regression and the
%   gradient of the cost w.r.t. to the parameters. 

n = length(y); % number of training examples
    
% cost: J, this time with the penalty for the magnitude of theta
J = -1/n * sum(y' * log(sigmoid(X * theta)) + (1 - y)' * log(1 - sigmoid(X * theta))) + lambda / (2 * n) * sum(theta(2:end) .* theta(2:end));

% gradient: compute as the derivative of the cost function
grad = 1/n * X' * ((sigmoid(X * theta)) - y) + theta * lambda / n;
   
% we do not regularize the constant offset term, 
% undo the gradient penalization for the constant x_0 term
grad(1) = grad(1) - lambda / n * theta(1); % regularization should not be applied to the first term.
